# Mirror, mirror

*Mirror, mirror* uses [trackingjs](https://trackingjs.com/), [p5js](https://p5js.org/), and [React](https://reactjs.org/) to build a responsive GUI that continuously changes as it detects your face, mouth, and eyes. It was built during a four-day hackathon at [Fullstack Academy of Code](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/).
